## Before Running the Script:

I've set it up so that the repositiory's directory is supposed to be in the user's home directory. This may or may not cause issues if the repository is placed outside of that /home/(user)/ directory.

These tools are for AMD64 based architecture Kali Linux. If you use a different distribution, architecture, or use x86 for some reason, then some of these tools may not install/work correctly. Some github tools offer versions for different linux distributions and architecture, so double checking the code to make sure you're machine is compatible would be best. 

This script uses sudo to download all of the tools. Be sure to have sudo permissions before attempting to run this script.
You will need to add executable permissions to the tools.sh script as well. 

There maybe bugs in the code casue I'm a shit coder. So let me know if there are any problems. (or fix them yourselves idc)


## Disclaimer:

I do NOT own any of the tools that are in this script. All of the credit goes to their respective creators. This is simply a script to download them all rather than having to find them yourselves. 

I'm also NOT responsible for any misuse of the tools. These tools should be used for ethical purposes or on your own environment.
